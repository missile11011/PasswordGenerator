![Portfolio screenshot](/passgen.PNG)

## About The Project
This web application generates a password for you. It creates a random password with certain parameters. You will be promoted with a message asking for how many characters you would like the password to be. Then you will be presented with multiple parameters like if you want your password to include uppercase and or lowercase and so on.

## Built With
This web application was built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for styling. The CSS was already given to me. But the rest I did myself.
